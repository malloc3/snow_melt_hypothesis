# snow_melt_hypothesis
Scripts associated with assessing the effect of snow melt on Mountain Yellow Legged Frogs in the Eastern Sierras 

These Scripts are highly dependent on Ned Bair's work from https://github.com/edwardbair/ParBal/blob/master/getMelt.m 
Some of Ned Bairs scripts have been adapted or otherwise used to reanalyze his data and combine it with the Ribbitr data to determine how snow melt in the sierras is associed with Mountain Yellow Legged Frog
population health in the eastern sierras.

The driving theory is that increased melt rates should be associated with increased rates of BD infection.   

The spatial data obtained by Ned Bair is quite large.  So several steps have been taken to reduce these data into chunks managable by an average personal computer.   Furthermore some scripts for analysis are
more easily done in MatLab and other in Python.  For this work I shall be using both languages (and maybe even shome shell scripts).   I apologize to my future self and anyone interested in this work.  Good luck 
and god speed.
